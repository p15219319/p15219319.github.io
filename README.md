## Background
This website is a portfolio created for myself. I used HTML to create and
structure the webpages, CSS to apply styling to them and JavaScript to
add behaviour to the pages.


My projects are loaded onto the webpage from my GitHub profile, these are
read from JSON and JavaScript is used to add them onto the page. Information
such as the project name, description and total number of commits are presented
onto the page.


The website is built mobile-first, and as a single page application
