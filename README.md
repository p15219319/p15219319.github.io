# CTEC3905: Front-End Web development | As-ad Patel - P15219319

## Background
This website is a portfolio created for myself. I used HTML to create and
structure the webpages, CSS to apply styling to them and JavaScript to
add behaviour to the pages.


My projects are loaded onto the webpage from my GitHub profile, these are
read from JSON and JavaScript is used to add them onto the page. Information
such as the project name, description and total number of commits are presented
onto the page.


The website is built mobile-first, and as a single page application. All
pages have been validated and there are no errors, the design was tested on  
multiple different screen sizes ranging from a mobile phone to a tablet and
computer screen. The CSS was adjusted accordingly to work for all of these.
GitHub API was used to get JSON data for my project listings, including each
projects name, description and number of commits. This was then loaded onto
the page using JavaScript.
